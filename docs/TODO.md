# TODO

Future enhancements and ideas for the Social Ad Creator.

---

## High Priority

### UI Reorganization

- [ ] Swap presets and layout sections - Layout should come before Presets in the tab
- [ ] Layout-specific presets - Only show presets that work with the currently selected layout (layout must be selected first)
- [ ] Separate platform and display sections - Split into two distinct areas
- [ ] Collapse platform selector by default - Less overwhelming on initial load

### Export Improvements

- [ ] Change "Download All" to "Download Multiple" - Add selection UI to choose which platforms to export

### Bug Fixes / Validation

- [ ] Verify all interactive selectors update when layout changes - Cell selectors, text placement, image assignment should all reflect new cell count

## Potential Improvements

### Content & Presets

- [ ] Save/load designs to localStorage
- [ ] Template gallery with complete designs

### Visual Effects

- [ ] More overlay types (diagonal gradient, radial from corner)
- [ ] Animation preview for story formats

### Usability

- [ ] Aspect ratio lock for custom sizes
- [ ] Image cropping/repositioning within frame

### Technical

- [ ] TypeScript migration
- [ ] Unit tests for config utilities
- [ ] PWA support for offline use
