## Worked on
UI improvements to Media, Style, and Platform sections

## Accomplished

- Moved Image Overlay section above Advanced Filters in MediaTab
- Added on/off toggle button for Image Overlay (similar to Grayscale toggle)
- Clicking selected overlay type/color now deselects them (toggle behavior)
- Made platform categories collapsible (only category with selected platform expanded by default)
- Made Typography section in Style tab collapsed by default
- Overlay controls now only show when overlay is enabled

## Current state
- **Build**: Passes successfully
- **All features**: Working

## Key context

- Image Overlay section now has On/Off toggle that sets opacity to 0 or 50
- Platform categories are collapsible with chevron toggle
- When a category is collapsed, it shows the selected platform name if any
- Typography section starts collapsed to reduce visual clutter
