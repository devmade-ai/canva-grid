## Worked on
Updated tutorial and documentation to reflect broader tool scope beyond "social media ads".

## Accomplished

1. **Updated TutorialModal.jsx** - Changed Welcome ("social media ads" → broader description), Content ("ad copy" → "text"), Export ("finished ad" → "finished design")
2. **Updated CLAUDE.md** - Project overview now describes CanvaGrid as a visual design tool with multi-page support
3. **Updated README.md** - Same broader description
4. **Updated USER_GUIDE.md** - Overview and tagline updated
5. **Updated TODO.md** - Changed "static ad creator" to "static design tool"

## Current state

- **Working** - All documentation and tutorial content now reflects CanvaGrid's broader scope (social posts, ads, presentations, stories, multi-page documents)

## Key context

- The tool evolved from a social media ad creator to a general-purpose visual design tool with multi-page support
- Tutorial, README, CLAUDE.md, USER_GUIDE.md, and TODO.md all previously had narrow "social media ads" framing
- The CLAUDE.md AI Note about keeping TutorialModal up to date is still relevant
